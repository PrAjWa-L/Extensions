Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

Objective:
To learn how to identify, evaluate, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions, improving overall browser security and performance.

What I Did:

1. Accessed the Extension Manager:
   - Visited chrome://extensions/ (Chrome) to view all installed extensions.

2. Reviewed Installed Extensions:
   - Evaluated each extension's purpose.
   - Checked developer reputation, user reviews, and permissions requested.

3. Evaluated Permissions:
   - Paid close attention to extensions requesting access to all site data, clipboard, and browser history.
   - Flagged any that had unclear usage or werenâ€™t in active use.

4. Removed Unused or Suspicious Extensions:
   - Uninstalled extensions that were no longer needed or had vague descriptions.

5. Restarted the Browser:
   - Ensured smooth performance and validated extension removal.

6. Researched Browser Extension Security:
   - Understood how some extensions can pose risks by accessing sensitive data or modifying web content.

Extensions Removed:

Extension Name         Reason for Removal
PDF Viewer Plus        No longer needed, requested unnecessary permissions
Quick Notes            Inactive usage, unclear data policy                
Weather Now            Asked for location and site data access            

Key Learnings:

- Extensions can become security liabilities if left unchecked.
- Permissions should always align with functionality.
- Regular audits improve both browser performance and privacy.
- Even trusted-looking extensions should be reviewed before installing.
